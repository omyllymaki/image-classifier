# Photo Classifier

Photo classifier based on pretrained CNN model and transfer learning.

Currently supports only single-class classification.

You can test classifier by downloading set of Google images.

## Downloading Google images

If you want to download more than 100 images per keyword, then 
you will need to download chromedriver. You can get if from here:

https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads

Download correct driver and move it to root directory of this repository.

Run download_google_images.py script to get images for classification task. This
will create data folder containing images of specified image classes. By default, the
script will load images of teddybears, grizzly bears and black bears.

## Notebooks

**model_training.ipynb**

Loads image data and trains CNN model. Saves trained model as pickle file.

**model_evaluation.ipynb**

Loads trained model and evaluates results and performance of the model using holdout test set.

## CLI app

Simple CLI app for training model and classifying images.

**Model training**

Usage: cli_app.py train [OPTIONS]

Options:

-s, --source TEXT         Folder path containing labeled images, labels as subfolder names

-t, --target TEXT         Path where model will be saved

-b, --batch_size INTEGER  Batch size for model training

-e, --epochs INTEGER      Number of epochs for model training

--early_stop BOOLEAN      Use early stop in model training

--help                    Show this message and exit.

**Classification of images**

Usage: cli_app.py classify [OPTIONS]

Options:

-m, --model TEXT          Model file path

-s, --source TEXT         Folder path containing images

-t, --target TEXT         Folder path where results will be saved

-type, --image_type TEXT  Image extension

--help                    Show this message and exit.
